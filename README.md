This repository serves as a curated portfolio of my data engineering projects, coursework, and hands-on exercises as I progress through the **MIT Professional Certificate in Data Engineering** program. It highlights my growing experience with data pipelines, version control, data modeling, and analytics-focused engineering workflows.

## Skills & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Data Engineering:** ETL pipelines, data modeling, workflow design  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub  
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git Bash, VS Code  
- **Concepts:** Relational databases, reproducible workflows, technical documentation

## Projects

### 🔹 Data Engineering Project Hub (This Repository)
A centralized index of my data engineering work, including coursework exercises and independent practice projects, designed to evolve alongside my studies.

### 🔹 MIT PCDE Coursework — Activity 9.1
An introductory data engineering exercise completed as part of the MIT Professional Certificate in Data Engineering program, focused on Python-based data handling and reproducible notebook workflows.

**Skills demonstrated:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Git, GitHub
